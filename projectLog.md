# openGL cube

## Assignment

The goal of this project is to create a cube in openGL which is able to follow the orientation of an external physical cube. This cube contains a gyroscope and accelerometer which provides movement data to the openGL cube. In addition the goal is to create a functioning Rubiks cube if sufficient time is available

## Plan of approach

1. Rendering a window in py openGL
2. Create triangle in py openGL
3. Add shaders to triangle
4. Create multiple triangles to create a flat cube
5. add Z dimension to create 3D cube
6. Create a row of 3 x 3 cubes
7. Add keyboard listener
8. Add cube interactivity based off of key presses (rotate single 3 x 3 face)
9. Create a complete cube 3 x 3 x 3
10. Implement key press face rotation to cube

### Creating a triangle

- Generating triangle
- Applying shaders to triangle

- Difficulty finding tutorials that don't use libraries such as GLU
